## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a recent graduate from University of Tennessee, Knoxville with a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering (concentration in Transportation Engineering) and an M.S in Statistics. I am a self-motivated problem solver, passionate about using scientific methodology and to solve real world problems and finding actionable insights. I am practicing ML/DL applications, designing experiments, predictive analytics, and causal inference to solve open-ended problems.

- ðŸŒ± My doctoral research was on "Using Heuristic Methods and Machine Learning to enhance the positional Accuracy of Historical Geospatial Datasets". 

- âš¡ Hobbies: I love being in the nature, mostly hiking. I also love playing soccer, tennis and reading.
